## The Journey Begins

I have started learning JavaScript at Codecademy as part of my journey to become a full stack developer! I don't know if I'll be able to stay focused in my track but it is what it is and I have to do it! I am adding the course manual I'll be learning and the source codes of the projects I'll be learning, to this repo.

### Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is among the most powerful and flexible programming languages of the web. It powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one.

### Take-Away Skills:

You will learn programming fundamentals and basic object-oriented concepts using the latest JavaScript syntax. The concepts covered in these lessons lay the foundation for using JavaScript in any environment.

### Up Next:

After learning JavaScript basics (up through the Objects lesson), try applying JavaScript to:

**[`Build games`](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-phaser).**
**[`Build interactive websites`](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/build-interactive-websites).**
**[`Build web applications with React`](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101).**
